# CMSI 402 Project Proposal: Panel Jumper by Alex Verdin

## 2.0 Preliminary Project Proposal: Panel Jumper
### Description
Panel Jumper is a two-dimensional infinite jumper game.
Think about the game doodle jump and the concept of this game will be a bit easier to understand.
However, unlike doodle jump, the player does not jump off of platforms but rather off of vertical platforms.
Essentially the character will be wall jumping in order to gain higher ground rather
than jumping from horizontal platforms. This game is meant to invoke wall jumping game mechanics
that can be seen in Super Mario like games, into an infinite jumper like game.

## 3.0 Project Proposal: Panel Jumper
### Description
Panel Jumper is a two-dimensional infinite jumper game.  Think about the game doodle jump and the concept of this game will be a bit easier to understand.  However, unlike doodle jump, the player does not jump off of platforms but rather off of vertical platforms.  Essentially the character will be wall jumping in order to gain higher ground rather than jumping from horizontal platforms.  This game is meant to invoke wall jumping game mechanics that can be seen in Super Mario like games, into an infinite jumper like game.  This game will be made available for PC and Mac play.  An attempt will be made to make the game work on Android and IOS devices as well.  Panel Jumper will be developed using the Unity game engine and all code will be written in C#.  The primary user of this game would be anyone with a few minutes of free time that are looking to play a game that is easy to understand.  Potential maintenance of this game would primarily revolve around in game glitches and would be solved by the developer of the game.

### Justification
This project provides good use of programming skills as well as creative skills.  Programming will be used to create all the game mechanics which is in conjunction with my major as a Computer Scientist.  However, this project will require the use of some animation skills which I have learned in other classes to some extent.  Although the game is simple in its initial design, there are some aspects of this project that will provide a sufficient amount of difficulty.  For example, although I have some experience with making animations and putting sprites into a game, I have yet to actually make my own digital sprites and implement them in a game.  Another goal of mine is to implement an online leader board system and make the game available to play by the end of the semester.  I have no real experience doing this so this will provide a significant amount of difficulty to the project.  However, I have worked on this game to some extent already and feel that this is a natural progression of my ability to make an interesting and complete game by the end of the semester.
