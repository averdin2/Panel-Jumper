# 4.0 Software Development Plan

## 4.1 SDP Introduction
This Software Development Plan provides the planned details for the development
of the two-dimensional infinite jumper game Panel Jumper.

Panel Jumper provides users with a familiar game style likened to games like Doodle Jump, yet provides a new and unique experience by integrating wall-jumping mechanics into the gameplay. As part of development the following main tasks will be completed: Initial planning of game features and gameplay concepts, development on animations, development on gameplay, development on menus, and development on leaderboards. The following is a brief list of basic sub-tasks and completion dates:
D01-Initial Planning (week 2), D02-Initial Animations (week 4), D03-Initial Game Mechanics (week 5), D04 Initial Game HUD (week 7), D05-Initial Menus (week 9), D06-Initial Leaderboards (week 9), D07-Initial Game Testing Begins (week 9), D08-Final Game Assets (not-animations) Completed (week 10), D09-Begin IOS Development (week 10), D10-Game Testing Ends (week 14), D11-Final Animations (week 14), D12-Game Menus Final (Week 14), D13-Final Game Mechanics Implementation (week 15), D14-Final Game Leaderboards Development (week 16), D15-Final IOS Development (week 16), D16-Final Game Deployment/Code Freeze (week 17).

### 4.1.1 Project Deliverables
#### 4.1.1.1 D01-Initial Planning (Final Completion: Week 2)
##### 4.1.1.1.1 Game Features (Week 2):
- This deliverable includes what kinds of features will included into the game for the project. This includes planning for IOS development, leaderboards, and menus.
##### 4.1.1.1.2 Game Mechanics (Week 2):
- This deliverable includes planning for the actual game mechanics and gameplay, such as wall jumping mechanics, score indications, and when the game will result in a game over.

#### 4.1.1.2 Animation Development (Final Completion: Week 14)
##### 4.1.1.2.1 D02-Initial Animations (Week 4):
- This deliverable includes making scrap character animations to be used as placeholders until final animations are completed. This is necessary to allow time to become proficient with creating and using the animation software.
##### 4.1.1.2.2 D11-Final Animations (Week 14):
- This deliverable includes the final completion of the character animations for the game. The amount of time that is allotted for this task is to ensure that adequate time can be allocated to other game deliverables, and animations can be worked on concurrently with other deliverables. There are two sub-animations to be worked on.
###### 4.1.1.2.2.1 Final Run Animations (Week 12):
- This deliverable includes the final completion of character movement animations. It may be probable that this will be completed sooner.
###### 4.1.1.2.2.2 Final Jump Animations (Week 14):
- This deliverable includes the final completion of character jumping animations. This is saved for the last aspect of the animation development to allow time for potentially numerous different animations for the jumps/panel jumps.

#### 4.1.1.3 Gameplay Development (Final Completion: Week 17)
##### 4.1.1.3.1 D03-Initial Game Mechanics (Week 5):
- This deliverable includes completing initial movement, jumping, and panel jumping controls and mechanics. It is highly likely that the initial movement controls will be the final side-to-side movement controls so no additional development will be needed. Jumping mechanics such as the panel jump will be subject to change/balancing after testing begins.
##### 4.1.1.3.2 D04-Initial Game Heads Up Display (HUD) (Week 7):
###### 4.1.1.3.2.1 Camera Follow (Week 7):
- This deliverable includes the ability for the camera to follow the player as he/she gains altitude from panel jumping. This deliverable is required before the following deliverable can be started. Note: This deliverable should not take considerable time, and thus can be considered concurrent with the following deliverable, but must technically be completed beforehand. The functionality of this deliverable should not change from this point on unless an error persists.
###### 4.1.1.3.2.2 Game Scoring (Week 7):
- This deliverable includes completion of display information such as high-score and current score that will be displayed during the main game. This should ensure that scoring is properly calculated and displayed to the player. Due to later game balancing, the amount of score the player earns, and thus the amount that is displayed to the player, will be subject to change. However, the ability to display the score is what this deliverable entails. Changes to the graphics of how the scoring is displayed may be subject to change after this deliverable.
###### 4.1.1.3.2.3 Player Wrap-Around (Week 7):
- This deliverable includes the ability for the player to crossover one side of the screen (right or left) and end up on the other side of the screen. This deliverable can be worked concurrently with the previous two deliverables. Note: The functionality of this deliverable should not change from this point on unless an error persists.
##### 4.1.1.3.3 D07-Initial Game Testing Begins (Week 9):
- Note: Although not a deliverable in the previously mentioned deliverables, initial panel generation must be finished before testing can begin in week 9. This deliverable is expected to be completed by week 8. If any other previous gameplay deliverables are not completed by this time, initial game testing cannot begin and must be pushed back,
- This deliverable includes the start of gameplay testing. This testing should be used to balance the game and will include testing to the difficulty of the game, score awarded to players, overall enjoyment, and any unknown glitches. Game mechanics will be purposely changed and tested during this time. Initially, the game will be tested by me only (weeks 9-10) and will be given to others to test in weeks 11-14. A considerable amount of time should be spent only on game testing and balance. Individual days should be dedicated to this within weeks 9-14.
##### 4.1.1.3.4 D08-Final Game Assets (not-animations) Completed (Week 10):
- Note: This deliverable includes some points that are relevant to game menu development and will not be included in this section.
###### 4.1.1.3.4.1 Panel Assets (Week 9-10):
- This deliverable includes completing the initial prefabs for the various different types of panels that will be included in the game. These panels will vary in size and color. Game mechanics for the different types of panels may not be completed by this time.
###### 4.1.1.3.4.2 HUD Scoring Elements (Week 10):
- This deliverable includes completion of the final HUD scoring graphics displayed to the player. Note: They may be the initial HUD Scoring graphics if time is scarce.
###### 4.1.1.3.4.3 Game Backgrounds (Week 9):
- This deliverable includes completion of the final game backgrounds or color options that the player may choose for the background. Note: Optional background colors may not be a final feature.
###### 4.1.1.3.4.4 Player Colors (Week 9):
- This deliverable includes completion of the final player colors or options that may be in the game. Note: Optional player colors may not be implemented in the final game.
###### 4.1.1.3.4.5 Game Sounds (Week 10):
- This deliverable includes completion of the final game sounds and music. Note: Game music will be implemented but additional game sounds may not be implemented. In the case that additional game sounds are made, this deliverable may be extended well beyond week 10.
##### 4.1.1.3.5 D09-Begin IOS Development (Week 10):
- This deliverable includes beginning work on IOS development for the project. Note: Completion of gameplay mechanics must be up to D07 before this deliverable can practically be started.
##### 4.1.1.3.6 D10-Game Testing Ends (Week 14):
- This deliverable includes the final completion of Game Testing. At this point, all data should be collected and assessed to come up with the final game balancing that will be implemented for the final version of the game.
##### 4.1.1.3.7 D13-Final Game Mechanics Implementation (Week 15):
- This deliverable includes the final implementation of the data gathered in testing and it should be applied to the final version of the game.
###### 4.1.1.3.7.1 Panel Generation (Week 8-15):
- Panel generation includes the random generation of panels on the screen during gameplay. An initial version of this should be completed by week 8 in order to ensure testing by week 9. As implementation of other types of panels is included, this panel generation should be updated.
###### 4.1.1.3.7.2 Movement/Jumping Mechanics (Week 15):
- Should testing require changes to movement, this deliverable includes the necessary changes to movement.
- Testing will more than likely require the changes to jumping mechanics which will continuously be updated due to feedback from testing.
##### 4.1.1.3.8 D15-Final IOS Development (Week 16):
- This deliverable includes the final implementation of the data gathered in testing and it should be applied to the final version of the game being developed for IOS/mobile.
##### 4.1.1.3.9 D16-Final Game Deployment/Code Freeze (week 17):
- This deliverable includes extra time that may be needed to work on deliverables that may have extended beyond their planed date.

#### 4.1.1.4 Menu/Leaderboards Development (Final Completion: Week 16)
##### 4.1.1.4.1 D05-Initial Game Menus (Week 9):
###### 4.1.1.4.1.1 Initial Main Menu (Week 9):
- This deliverable includes the ability to change from the main menu scene, to the gameplay scene, to the options scene, and to quit the game application. This includes the creation of buttons to act as indications for changing scenes. The graphics of the main menu are subject to change.
###### 4.1.1.4.1.2 Initial Game Over Menu (Week 9):
- This deliverable includes the addition of a pop up game over screen that occurs upon player's failure. The initial game over menu will display buttons for resetting the game, returning to the main menu, options, and quitting the game application. The graphics of the game over menu are subject to change.
###### 4.1.1.4.1.3 Initial Options Menu (Week 9):
- This deliverable includes a placeholder options button in both the main menu and game over menu, as well as a placeholder options scene to be implemented later on in development.
##### 4.1.1.4.2 D06-Initial Leaderboards (Week 9):
- This deliverable includes a basic leaderboard system that allows the user to enter a new name that will be saved along with obtaining a new high score. This initial leaderboard will only hold on to ten names and scores locally, and will be displayed by navigating through the options menu. Note: This is a potential placeholder for later online implementation of this functionality. In the case that development does not give enough time to implement online functionality, this version will be implemented into the final game.
##### 4.1.1.4.3 D08-Final Game Assets (not-animations) Completed (Week 10):
- Note: Some deliverables of this section are seen in the game development sections of this document and will not be seen in this section.
###### 4.1.1.4.3.1 Final Main Menu Graphics (Week 10):
- This deliverable includes the final implementation of the graphics that will be applied to the main menu for the final version of the game.
###### 4.1.1.4.3.2 Final Game Over Menu Graphics (Week 10):
- This deliverable includes the final implementation of the graphics that will be applied to the game over menu for the final version of the game.
###### 4.1.1.4.3.3 Options Menu Graphics (Week 10):
- This deliverable includes the final implementation of the graphics that will be applied to the game over menu for the final version of the game. Note: Functionality for all aspects of the menu may not be completed at this time, and will be completed later in the development.
##### 4.1.1.4.4 D12-Final Game Menus (Week 14):
- This deliverable includes the completion of all aspects of the game menu development. This deliverable should primarily include work on the options menu functionality, but may include changes to graphics if needed.
##### 4.1.1.4.5 D14-Final Game Leaderboards Development (Week 16):
- This deliverable includes the completion of the Leaderboards development for implementation into the final game. The main goal for this final leaderboard is to hold an indefinite amount of names and scores on a server to be displayed to users. In the case that development does not allow this, an alternate top 20-50 scores and names will be implemented instead. Note: In the case that online functionality is not completed, the initial leaderboard will be used for the final version of the game.

## 4.3 Project Organization
The Panel Jumper project workload has been divided into four main tasks that need to be accomplished being: Initial Planning, Game Development, Animation Development, and Menu/Leaderboard Development. The Panel Jumper game is being developed by a single person so many functions will be developed concurrently or within the same weeks as other functions. The following will describe how a brief development plan for the four main tasks.
### 4.3.1 Initial Planning:
- Initial planning will start from the very first day of development and continue into and finish in week 2. This time is used for planning the game.
### 4.3.2 Game Development:
- This section will take up the majority of time for overall project development. Most of the time and effort should be spent on this task. Other tasks may be worked on simultaneously, but this task should be the primary focus for most development weeks. In the case that development on other tasks falls too far behind, focus should remain mostly on this task. Note: This task is focused on actual gameplay development, not necessarily the entire parts of the game as a whole.
### 4.3.3 Animation Development:
- Animation development essentially has only two stages that will be worked on in the beginning and throughout the course of the project (see section 4.1.1.2 for more details). Minimal time should be spent on this task and it can take up only a couple hours per week for development. Other tasks should be worked on the same day that animation development occurs.
### 4.3.4 Menu/Leaderboard Development:
- The primary focus of this task should be on completing menu functionality, specifically the options menu functionality. Leaderboard functionality is more of a wanted feature but attention may need to be focused back if time is short. Some Menu development should occur during days between actual game development. If more time is required for this task, it may be pushed into the final week unless game development needs more time in which the initial sub-tasks of this task will be the final implementation of the game. The Options menu does not have a real initial iteration and should be developed alongside game developments that allow for the functionality that will be seen in the options menu. The Options menu is the real focus of this task in the development.
