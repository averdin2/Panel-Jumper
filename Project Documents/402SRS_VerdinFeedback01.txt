PanelJumper Project SRS Evaluation
==================================

Nice job on this, a very good document.

This is fairly complete, good coverage of the basic requirements.  One
thing to note, having a single requirement with a bunch of "will's"
underneath it isn't really quite the way to specify the software.  You
need to have some hard requirements, with numbers.  For example, all
of the "will" statements under section 5.2.1.1 should be numbered
requirements.  Another example, in 5.2.1.2, the first bullet should be
requirement 5.2.1.2.1 and the "will" statement should specify the
"easy, medium, and hard" levels.

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
