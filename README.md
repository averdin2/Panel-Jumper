# Panel-Jumper

## Description
Panel Jumper is a two-dimensional infinite jumper game.
Think about the game doodle jump and the concept of this game will be a bit easier to understand.
However, unlike doodle jump, the player does not jump off of platforms but rather off of vertical platforms.
Essentially the character will be wall jumping in order to gain higher ground rather
than jumping from horizontal platforms. This game is meant to invoke wall jumping game mechanics
that can be seen in Super Mario like games, into an infinite jumper like game.
